# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?  
 We started by drawing a physical map of where each shop would go. Then we wrote out what methods we wanted to have in each class. We used interfaces to organize what methods would go where. For the second draft, we deleted the interfaces once we implemented them and built out our methods more robustly. Putting everything together in main was the last step as we made the game interactable.
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?  
 We learned how to use switch cases and got more comfortable with connecting classes together. We also got more comfortable with scanners. We overall, got better at teamwork. Additionally, we got better at coding outside of office hours and tutor hours.
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 When we were organizing our thoughts, we found it really helpful to use whiteboards and wish we had been using them before. Very helpful! We also wish we had learned about switch cases earlier because they were so helpful when we were putting everything together in main.
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?  
 We would implement a functioning wallet â€“ this was something we wanted to do but ran out of time. We would also have individual stylists that you could choose from in NailSalon and HairSalon. Having graphics would have also been cool!
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?  
 Jordan gave us some good ideas about how to organize our classes as subclasses of Building, and guided us in how to use switch cases instead of a bunch of nested if else statements.
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?  
 Use a whiteboard to start. Start on the wallet earlier so that it could have a better chance of being implemented.
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.  
 We kept our expectations for what we could implement realistic. We had good communication and were able to meet at least once a week for about two hours outside of class. When we did meet together, we were able to organize what we wanted our code to look like and it made coding on our own more guided.
