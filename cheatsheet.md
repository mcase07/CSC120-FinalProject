This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.

Note: We decided to not make this list available inside the game because certain the player can only use certain commands based on their location. Since that's the case, we clearly tell the user when they can use what commands. 

When the game first begins, the initial "command" to start the game is to enter your name (case sensitive)
Then, you're taken to home.
Home:
    - "east"

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.
